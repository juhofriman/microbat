# Microbat

Relational database. Maybe. Someday.

It's really not operational. It is just for fun and learning.

## Usage

Currently `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` is not implemented. Microbat adds some dummy data on boot. Use `SHOW TABLES` to get started.

```
cargo run --bin microbat_server
```

```
cargo run --bin microbat_client
```
